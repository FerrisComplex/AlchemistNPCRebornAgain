		EntryM4: Shhhhh! You'll ruin my recording!

		EntryM6: Look, your enthusiasm is awesome, but could you maybe record the next boss track yourself? I don't really want to risk my life for some tunes.
		EntryM7: Ah, I see you were able to save the Explorer! Well done! Perhaps my next song is going to be about your triumph.

		EntryO1: How is your day, Manager? Can I help you?
		EntryO2: That 'The Great Thunder Bird' doesn't seems so dangerous. I am only hoping that it isn't a part of Apocalypse Bird...
		EntryO3: Hello, Manager! Isn't this day silent, is it?
		EntryO4: Do you want anything special, Manager?
		EntryO5: Eater of Worlds is an Abnormality with risk class TETH. And now it is contained. Do you need something from it?
		EntryO6: If you manage to supress Ragnarok, then you could do everything imaginable.
		EntryO7: Eye of Cthulhu is a pretty strange creature. It seems like it is just a small part of something really dangerous. It would be better for us if it never escapes.
		EntryO8: Brain of Cthulhu may look horrifying, but without its minions it can't do anything.
		EntryO9: Something changed in this world, Manager. Evil is spreading even wider, but at the same time, my sensor system caught the birth of new biome, called Hallow.
		EntryO10: All these Mechanical Bosses... They definitely could have Trauma origin. What classification numbers will they get? I think they would be started as T-05-...
		EntryO11: Goblins... Such a pathetic creatures. And the only useful things from them are just Spiky Balls and Harpoons.
		EntryO12: Pretty strange Abnormal event... They all look as living creatures, but their 'Flying Dutchman' is definetly a ghost with HE risk class.
		EntryO13: Martians came again. Last time they were here, several big towns were destroyed. But we could say as an excuse that we weren't as ready, as we were now.
		EntryO14: Blood Moon? Shouldn't it happen once in 666 years?
		EntryO15: All these strange cratures just keep coming and coming to this 'Beacon'... Hope we all will survive until Dawn.
		EntryO16: Anyway, there are some reasons for optimism. Blood Moon attracts some creatures, which cannot be seen in normal conditions.
		EntryO17: I read a few manuscripts about creature, named Slime God. They say that he is one of the first creatures in this world.
		EntryO18: Yharim... I am pretty sure I heard that name before. But my memory data is corrupted. Try asking Calamitas about him...
		EntryO19: This carnivorous plant was really dangerous... Looks like it was at least HE Risk Class. Glad to see you again in one piece after all.
		EntryO20: This ancient machine was holding celestial powers inside. With its death, world can change forever...
		EntryO21: An insect the size of the Queen Bee defies current methods of classification. I propose insects of this size be given a new classification MI-XX. It is a wonder that nobody has used them for their own means, let us be the first.
		EntryO22: It appears I was wrong about the queen bees. Their memory storage contains the ramblings of a scientist who was blinded by ambition and cruelly introduced the plague to them. Let us classify them as MP-0X.
		EntryO23: According to my notes, this Coznix you speak of was a lesser Void Observer, classified as OB-V-01. There are greater threats waiting beyond the veil of reality.
		EntryO24: This flying scouter..... curious. From the memory banks stored in the wreckage, this looks to have been a scouting ship for the Martians, to determine how hospitable Terraria is. I fear the pilot's last moments have been transmitted to the main Martian command centre.
		EntryO25: Turning a mages' power in on himself and trapping him within it is no easy task, but to observe cruelty of such magnitude..... Permafrost, former lord of the Ice Castle, may you see peace.
		EntryO26: The Starplate raider is a Genius Stardust Centipede, or a G-S-C3, popular with the Martian elite as lifelong companions and raiding partners. It must have wandered far from home, judging from the transmitter memory banks I recovered.
		EntryO27: I took the time to analyze the remains of this incredible creature. Every time it attacked, the entire planet seemed to resonate against its will. I can do nothing but to worry about the consequences of its death. At least, you saved Terraria of certain doom..........again.
		EntryO28: Such an ancient presence is worth documenting - the material of its plates can withstand temperatures equal to the core of the Terrarian Sun! This will revolutionize containment procedures for ARS-0N prisoners if we can make materials half as resistant to heat!
		EntryO29: Whoever made the Ravager deserves to be put in HI-MAX containment. All those tortured souls....... Well, at least you put them out of their misery.
		EntryO30: Interesting... those Bumblebirbs were actually meant to be clones of Yharon. I’m glad that experiment was a failure!
		EntryO31: You were lucky that thing got complacent and didn't open a portal to the Sun on our heads. The sheer strength and intelligence it exhibited means I need to make a whole new category for the classification of Worms.
		EntryO32: I have my theories about the origin of this being, frightening more than his soul (if he even has one)... Irradiates negative energy, experimentation shown how in darkness this ''oblivion energy'', irradiated light but in light places irradiated shadow. I don't know where he came from but I know that whatever it is, it must be contained at any cost!
		EntryO33: Supreme Calamitas has been defeated but she speaks of a being even stronger than herself. We must hope that he hasn't taken notice of us yet.
		EntryO34: I’m honestly not sure why giant spinning skulls are the key to everything, but somehow they seem to contain the power of celestial beings within them...
		EntryO35: Yeah, I know that we are the ones capturing and farming horrifying eldritch entities. But who the hell thought It was a good idea to put loot bags inside a giant monster?!?!
		EntryO36: Кemember Manager, Treasure Bags are valuable but not everything comes inside them. That mutant man can help you get a boss's most elusive drops.

					A1: So, were my notes of any use to you?
					A2: I know about special materials which can help you.
					A3: You want to try Blade with power of Determination? Just make Extractor and get some Soul Essences and Hate Vials.
					A4: "''There's a legendary yoyo known as the Sasscade.''... I am pretty sure you heard about that before. But I know how you can get it."
					A5: If you want to take part in my researches, then grab my notes and check if you can help. All results will belong to you.
					A6: Luckily, I get my Interdimensional Casket with me, so I can make potions. My inventions, of course.
					A7: Celestial's Particles are pretty interesting... You can use them for crafting some special accessories and equipment or simply for making Celestial Fragments.
					A8: "If you've already found the Otherworldly Amulet, then you can ask "
					A9: " to sell Celestial Fragments."
					A10: That was the most powerful and dangerous creature in the jungle, but you killed it. Does that mean that you are now the most dangerous creature in the jungle?
					A11: Otherworldly Amulet has much more uses than you ever thought... It could help Alchemist to make Celestial's Particles, it could summon mount Poro for you and it is required for making Autoinjector or Watcher Amulet.
					A12: If you managed to create Watcher Amulet, then you could buy Flask of Rainbows from Young Brewer. It is a very powerful imbuement, which can help you overcome great enemies.

					A15: Messing with the quantic shroud is no fun-time business, hero. Be careful when choosing what power to pick on.
					A16: The time-space continuum is possibly the worst combination in this existance: both a delicate but mastercrafted estructure in a skillfully achieved but pathetically fragile balance and at the same time an absolute and undeniable force of nature that posseses total control of our everything and composes what we call ''reality and fiction'', volatile as you wouldn't believe.
					A17: Take it from someone with experience on it, friend: ''A flying giant divine cosmic worm of the heavens of who-damn-knows-what-deities is the most normal thing you'll find out there compared to what lurks in the darkness of deep space.''

					E1: How is your day, Manager? Can I help you?
					E2: That 'The Great Thunder Bird' doesn't seems so dangerous. I am only hoping that it isn't a part of Apocalypse Bird...
					E3: Hello, Manager! Isn't this day silent, is it?
					E4: Do you want anything special, Manager?
					E5: Eater of Worlds is an Abnormality with risk class TETH. And now it is contained. Do you need something from it?
					E6: If you manage to supress Ragnarok, then you could do everything imaginable.
					E7: Eye of Cthulhu is a pretty strange creature. It seems like it is just a small part of something really dangerous. It would be better for us if it never escapes.
					E8: Brain of Cthulhu may look horrifying, but without its minions it can't do anything.
					E9: Something changed in this world, Manager. Evil is spreading even wider, but at the same time, my sensor system caught the birth of new biome, called Hallow.
					E10: All these Mechanical Bosses... They definitely could have Trauma origin. What classification numbers will they get? I think they would be started as T-05-...
					E11: Goblins... Such a pathetic creatures. And the only useful things from them are just Spiky Balls and Harpoons.
					E12: Pretty strange Abnormal event... They all look as living creatures, but their 'Flying Dutchman' is definetly a ghost with HE risk class.
					E13: Martians came again. Last time they were here, several big towns were destroyed. But we could say as an excuse that we weren't as ready, as we were now.
					E14: Blood Moon? Shouldn't it happen once in 666 years?
					E15: All these strange cratures just keep coming and coming to this 'Beacon'... Hope we all will survive until Dawn.
					E16: Anyway, there are some reasons for optimism. Blood Moon attracts some creatures, which cannot be seen in normal conditions.
					E17: I read a few manuscripts about creature, named Slime God. They say that he is one of the first creatures in this world.
					E18: Yharim... I am pretty sure I heard that name before. But my memory data is corrupted. Try asking Calamitas about him...
					E19: This carnivorous plant was really dangerous... Looks like it was at least HE Risk Class. Glad to see you again in one piece after all.
					E20: This ancient machine was holding celestial powers inside. With its death, world can change forever...
					E21: An insect the size of the Queen Bee defies current methods of classification. I propose insects of this size be given a new classification MI-XX. It is a wonder that nobody has used them for their own means, let us be the first.
					E22: It appears I was wrong about the queen bees. Their memory storage contains the ramblings of a scientist who was blinded by ambition and cruelly introduced the plague to them. Let us classify them as MP-0X.
					E23: According to my notes, this Coznix you speak of was a lesser Void Observer, classified as OB-V-01. There are greater threats waiting beyond the veil of reality.
					E24: This flying scouter..... curious. From the memory banks stored in the wreckage, this looks to have been a scouting ship for the Martians, to determine how hospitable Terraria is. I fear the pilot's last moments have been transmitted to the main Martian command centre.
					E25: Turning a mages' power in on himself and trapping him within it is no easy task, but to observe cruelty of such magnitude..... Permafrost, former lord of the Ice Castle, may you see peace.
					E26: The Starplate raider is a Genius Stardust Centipede, or a G-S-C3, popular with the Martian elite as lifelong companions and raiding partners. It must have wandered far from home, judging from the transmitter memory banks I recovered.
					E27: I took the time to analyze the remains of this incredible creature. Every time it attacked, the entire planet seemed to resonate against its will. I can do nothing but to worry about the consequences of its death. At least, you saved Terraria of certain doom..........again.
					E28: Such an ancient presence is worth documenting - the material of its plates can withstand temperatures equal to the core of the Terrarian Sun! This will revolutionize containment procedures for ARS-0N prisoners if we can make materials half as resistant to heat!
					E29: Whoever made the Ravager deserves to be put in HI-MAX containment. All those tortured souls....... Well, at least you put them out of their misery.
					E30: Interesting... those Bumblebirbs were actually meant to be clones of Yharon. I’m glad that experiment was a failure!
					E31: You were lucky that thing got complacent and didn't open a portal to the Sun on our heads. The sheer strength and intelligence it exhibited means I need to make a whole new category for the classification of Worms.
					E32: I have my theories about the origin of this being, frightening more than his soul (if he even has one)... Irradiates negative energy, experimentation shown how in darkness this ''oblivion energy'', irradiated light but in light places irradiated shadow. I don't know where he came from but I know that whatever it is, it must be contained at any cost!
					E33: Supreme Calamitas has been defeated but she speaks of a being even stronger than herself. We must hope that he hasn't taken notice of us yet.
					E34: I’m honestly not sure why giant spinning skulls are the key to everything, but somehow they seem to contain the power of celestial beings within them...
					E35: Yeah, I know that we are the ones capturing and farming horrifying eldritch entities. But who the hell thought It was a good idea to put loot bags inside a giant monster?!?!
					E36: Кemember Manager, Treasure Bags are valuable but not everything comes inside them. That mutant man can help you get a boss's most elusive drops.
